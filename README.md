## Sorting algorythms
16 variant

Task:
- Type of sequence:
    - Sawtooth integer partially sorted sequence
- Types of sorting:
    1. Modded insertion sort (using signal key)
    2. Shell sort (sequence: $h_i = 3*h_{i-1} + 1$)
    3. MSD sort (digit: 1, 2, 4, 8 binary digits)

To check the implemented sorting functions, I need to develop
a function that checks the ordering of elements in a sequence
